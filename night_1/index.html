                Tonight I can write the saddest lines.
            </p>

            <p>
                I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.
            </p>

            <p>
                Through nights like this one I held her in my arms
            </p>

            <p>
                I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.
            </p>

            <p>        
                She loved me sometimes, and I loved her too.
            </p>

            <p>
                How could one not have loved her great still eyes.
            </p>
