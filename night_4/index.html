            <p>
             The same night whitening the same trees.
            </p>

            <p>
                We, of that time, are no longer the same.
            </p>

            <p>            
                I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her.
            </p>

            <p>  
                My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.
            </p>

            <p>                      
                Another's. She will be another's. Like my kisses before.
            </p>

            <p>
                Her voice. Her bright body. Her infinite eyes.
            </p>

            <p>
                I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her.
            </p>

            <p>
                Love is so short, forgetting is so long.
            </p>

           <p>               
            Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms
           </p>

           <p>
           my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.
           </p>

              <p>
                Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer
              </p>         

               <p>
                and these the last verses that I write for her.
               </p>
