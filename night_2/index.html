                Tonight I can write the saddest lines.
            </p>

            <p>
                To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.
            </p>

            <p>            
                To hear the immense night, still more immense without her.
            </p>

            <p>
                And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.
            </p>

            <p>        
                What does it matter that my love could not keep her.
