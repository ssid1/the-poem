                The night is shattered and she is not with me.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.
            </p>

            <p>            
                My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.
            </p>

            <p>  
              My sight searches for her as though to go to her.
            </p>

            <p>        
                My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.
